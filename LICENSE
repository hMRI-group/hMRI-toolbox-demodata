- Abstract: The hMRI toolbox is an open-source toolbox for the calculation of quantitative MRI parameter maps from a series of weighted imaging data, and optionally additional calibration data. The multi-parameter mapping (MPM) protocol, incorporating calibration data to correct for spatial variation in the scanner's transmit and receive fields, is the most complete protocol that can be handled by the toolbox. Here we present a dataset acquired with such a full MPM protocol, which is made freely available to be used as a tutorial by following instructions provided on the associated toolbox wiki pages, which can be found at http://hMRI.info, and following the theory described in: hMRI – A toolbox for quantitative MRI in neuroscience and clinical research [1].
