# Description
The directories `protocols` and `raw-data` respectively contain the MRI settings and sample data for multi-parameter mapping (MPM) to be used with the hMRI-toolbox (http://hmri.info).  
The data set is published in the context of the following article:

[Callaghan, M. F., Lutti, A., Ashburner, J., Balteau, E., Corbin, N., Draganski, B., ... & Weiskopf, N. (2019). Example dataset for the hMRI toolbox. Data in brief, 25, 104132.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2019.104132)

which is published under a `CC BY 4.0` license.

# Sample dataset (raw-data)
A sample dataset is provided as reference and material for exploring the possibilities and functionalities of the hMRI-toolbox. The according acquisition protocol can be found in `hmri_sample_dataset_protocol_800um_64ch.pdf` in the
`protocols` directory.

# Example MRI protocols (protocols)
Several example MRI protocols (standard MPM protocol using customised Siemens sequences, as well MPM protocol implemented using Siemens and Philips product sequences) as well as a setup (for Siemens 3T MRI) and usage tutorial. Please be aware that we provide these protocols and information without any warranty. They must be considered work-in-progress, possibly non-optimal protocols and information.
